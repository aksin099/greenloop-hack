GreenLoop is a specialized B2B marketplace ecosystem designed to accelerate and optimize the reconstruction process in the Karabakh region. By connecting construction companies with suppliers, the platform streamlines procurement, logistics, and resource management through a unified digital interface.

Unlike traditional marketplaces, GreenLoop integrates Artificial Intelligence to solve the unique challenges of large-scale regional redevelopment—such as complex logistics, volatile material pricing, and rigorous quality standards.
